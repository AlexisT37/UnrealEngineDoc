# Allow tick before begin to play

"Allow Tick before Begin Play" is a property in Unreal Engine that enables an actor to start receiving tick events before its "BeginPlay" event is called. The tick event is a regular update function that is called on every frame of the game, allowing you to perform various operations, such as updating the position, rotation, or logic of an actor. The "BeginPlay" event is called when an actor is spawned or when the level starts, allowing you to initialize variables, set up references, or perform any other necessary setup.

By default, an actor does not receive tick events until its "BeginPlay" event has been called. However, in some cases, you might want an actor to start receiving tick events even before "BeginPlay" is executed.

Let's use a concrete example to illustrate this concept:

Imagine you are creating a game with a day-night cycle, and you have a "SkyManager" actor responsible for updating the position of the sun and the moon, as well as the color and intensity of the sky. This "SkyManager" actor needs to tick every frame to update the sky's appearance smoothly.

Now, suppose your game also has a loading screen shown at the beginning of the level, and you want the day-night cycle to be updated even during the loading screen. The loading screen might be active before all other actors in the level, including the "SkyManager", have called their "BeginPlay" event.

In this situation, you can enable the "Allow Tick before Begin Play" property on the "SkyManager" actor. This will allow the "SkyManager" to start receiving tick events and updating the day-night cycle even before its "BeginPlay" event is called, ensuring that the sky appears correctly during the loading screen.

To enable "Allow Tick before Begin Play" on an actor:

    Select the actor in the level or the actor's Blueprint.
    In the Details panel, locate the "Tick" category.
    Check the box next to "Allow Tick before Begin Play".

Keep in mind that enabling this property can have implications for your game logic, as some initialization might not be completed before the tick events start occurring. Make sure to account for this in your implementation if you choose to enable this property.
