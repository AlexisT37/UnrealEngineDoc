# Focus Selected Actors in All Viewports

"Focus Selected Actors in All Viewports" is a feature in Unreal Engine that allows you to quickly center and zoom in on a selected actor or group of actors in all the open viewports. This can be helpful when working on a specific object or area in your level, as it saves time navigating in each viewport individually.

Let's use a concrete example to illustrate this concept:

Imagine you're working on a level that has a large outdoor environment with various buildings, trees, and props. You're currently focused on a particular building in the 3D viewport, but now you want to work on a small prop, like a bench, located elsewhere in the level.

To quickly focus on the bench in all viewports, follow these steps:

1. In the World Outliner or the 3D viewport, select the bench actor.
2. Press the "F" key on your keyboard or go to the "Edit" menu and select "Focus Selected Actors in All Viewports".

Now, all the open viewports (e.g., top, side, front, and perspective) will automatically center and zoom in on the selected bench actor, making it easier for you to work on that object.

Remember that the "Focus Selected Actors in All Viewports" feature only affects the viewport navigation in the editor and does not impact the in-game camera or gameplay. This feature is designed to streamline the editing process and help you navigate more efficiently within the editor.
