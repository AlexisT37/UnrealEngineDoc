# Moving Assets between projects

To do that, we're going to do what is called a migration.

In our downloaded content, there are some assets that we are going to move into our current project.
You can do that easily by using the asset drawer.

I tried to copy the content but it doesn't work, first you have to open the project in a new window using the file
IntroUnrealProject.uproject

Make sure to select the appropriate unreal engine version when opening this other project, for now it's 5.1

We put our current level with the crate in a window and reduce it a little.

Then with the windows explorer we go into the folder that came from the zip

0etq38Ro6eVZX7TK8pKQ_IntroUnreal5 > IntroUnreal5 > IntroUnrealProject

and then double click on IntroUnrealProject.uproject

I make a note that since this is a different window, you will realize that the fps are uncapped for this, so you need to re-enter the command
to cap the fps to 30.

Check the content of this other project with the content drawer

Go into All > Content > LightingExamples, and you will see the 4 folders like in the video
Maps
Materials
Meshes
Textures

Now we have our two projects side by side, we're going to open the content drawer in project A
The two projects should be open in  the Content folder, in project A you have Mystuff and StarterContent,
in Project B you have LightingExamples

Hover over the LightingExamples and right click and click Migrate

You well get a menu of migrating assets, call the asset report, click on ok
Then you are asked a location to migrate to in the windows file explorer.
Find your project folder

C:\Users\hotar\Documents\Unreal Projects\tutocastle\Content

And now in the starter content we have the lighting example YAHOUUUUUUUUUU

Note, you can always go to the content drawer, right click on a folder and do show on disk to find the location.
