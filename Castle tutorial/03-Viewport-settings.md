# Viewport Settings

There are a total of 7 viewport settings, including the default one which is perspective.

Here are the others:

top
bottom
left
right
front
back

They all have different shortcuts and I have a feeling I will have to configure separately all of the shortcuts for dvorak.

To go in directions, hold the right click, and to select several objects, hold the left key.  You can zoom in and out using the scrool wheel.
