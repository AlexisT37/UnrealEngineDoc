# Show

Show is on the right of view modes, and you can check and uncheck various boxes according to whether you want to display something or not.

A good example is that you can enable or disable the anti-aliasing, or the collisions, or the atmosphere, or the grid in the distant ground.

Since you can mess things up, like dissapearance of static meshes which hides all the tables and chairs and platforms, it's best to remember that you can go back to the default settings by clicking on use default at the top of the menu.

I just found that we can display the fps and realized that we've been running at 120 fps the whole time.

thanks to this reddit link, I know how to set the fps, for that go to the console.

Finally for tonight, we have the gameview, which toggles all the widgets but it's not exactly like play mode, but it allows us to see exactly what the player would see.
