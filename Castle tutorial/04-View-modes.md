# View modes

There are lots of view modes, I do like the wireframe one, it reminds me of the "affichage fil de fer" in oblivion,
the code was TWF, which now, I see, means Toggle Wireframe Mode. Takes me back, and takes me forward because I can't wait to move in this new scenery.

We will add more detail as time goes by to all of the elements, but for now, let's remember that there's 432. with 4 being the main one lit, then unlit, and wireframes 2.
You can hold alt + 4, 3, 2 to switch between these view modes.
