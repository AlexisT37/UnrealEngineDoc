# Large Details

The most recommended steps when you create environments is to create large details first and then little details later.

For example, we are going to do the landscape and the mountains first.
Then you can move on to the medium details like the trees and the castle, and then finally the finer detail like the grass, pebbles and shrubs.
This is to avoid having to redo the smaller details if you decide to change a mountain for example.
We're going to start by sculpting and adding some random hills around the perimeters, a bit before the edges of the map.
Tool Strength 0.3
Brush fallof 0.5
Size BIG

The map is a big rectangle, but if it feels too small for us then we can increase the size by adding to the landscape tool
Manage > Add + and then you can add little squares by clicking, or even hold the click to do it in a painting way.

In the same way that we adde a Player Start so that when we start the game, we always start with the character and cameraat the same location, we want to do the same with the viewport it seems.
