# Megascan

It's a huge library of free assets for Unreal Engine, and we're going to get assets for our project here.
First let's reset the texture of the landscape to the default by using the counter clockwise arrow on the material selection on the landscape details.
Note that if we can't select anything in the Outliner, it's probably because we are still in the landscape mode.
Now we're back to checker.
Now we're going to add a post process volume into the map
Add > Volumes > PostProcessVolume
Then we go to its details to set the exposure to manual
Metering Mode > Manual in the dropdown after checking the parameter
Exposure Compensation we check it, but there are no effects so far.
Then we check Post Processing volume settings >  infinite expand (Unbound).
We now can set the exposure compensation to 10, (was set to 11.5 in the video)
Now we are going to add elements, in the Main Viewport, select Add > Quixel Bridge.
This takes us to the menu for the assets.
