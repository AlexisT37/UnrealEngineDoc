# Camera

In the viewport, you can hold down the right click to look around.

Still holding the right click you can use wasd keys to move around.

Ok, this is impossible in dvorak, time to go edit the shortcuts.

The controls are pretty neat. WASD so ,aoe for directions, a => ' for down, e => . for up

We will have to check for conflicts in the future, and remember that if there is some command that doesn't respond it's probably because of this.

Oooh, time to fly away, in the upper right corner of the Viewport, you can click on the camera icon and adjust the camera speed to your liking.

This can go fast, the default setting is 4. The camera scalar allows to go even faster or slower, it changes the magnitude of increase.

You can use right click + the scroll to adjust the speed, let's see.

This is smooth, but it does not change the value in the upper right icon.

In case you get lost, you can select an object in the Outliner and press F to focus on it.

Ooh it's not even instant, there is a little bawoop effect.

This is another thing we're going to change thoug, so F => U

interesting, f was bound but shift + u was bound to something else becaus it's kind of an edge case, focus selected actors in all viewports, so we will leave it at that.

it might be useful when editing a scene later, but right know I sure won't need that as a shortcut. It's now present in Keyboard shortcuts.

so you can hold Alt + the left mouse button to rotate around a point in front of you, but more importantly, if you press U to focus on a specific object, the camera will then rotate around the object.

Oooh, I found out by mistake that by holding control and then clicking right or left, you can modify the X axis and Z axis respectively.

You also need to weave the mouse around. I have a feeling I might use the thumb button on my mouse to move something up if there isn't a shortcut already.

If you hold alt + right click, and weave the mouse up or down, you can zoom in or out of the point in front of you or the focused object.

Oooh, I finally found out how the previous guy from the other video created a slope, by holding control and right click and then weaving up or down with the mouse, you can change the inclination of an object.

Oooh but wait this is not the limited shortcut, you need to switch the modes in the upper right corner. There is selection, but also translate and select, select and rotate, and select and scale.
