# Cliffs

We are going to replace the regular landscape in the cliffs with actual cliffs.

We download them from the megascan again. This time we look for nordic cliffs.

When we have a lot of cliffs, and we have lots of files, we can go into the megascan folder and filter by static mesh.
This is very useful if we want to find only the rocks and other things.

This phase is pretty simple, you download a lot of cliff assets from the market place and then you put them in your world.
Because of nanite, it will never slow performance and you can add as many as you want. If you have holes you plug them
For the bottom of the cliff you can paint the ground with the 3rd material.
