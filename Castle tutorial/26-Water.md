# Water

First we need to dig the river bed.
We already did that so wait until the next instruction.
but remember shift + click to dig instead of sculpt upwards.
In order to get water, simply drag the water plane from the assets into the lake
Then the opacity. The more you decrease the opacity, the fainter the water is.
We have ripples, and the ripples are driven by the Ripple Normal intensity
0 is completely still, high values are more agitated.
Ripple tile, 0 is very small and large values make for large water ripples.
You can change the ripple speed to get fast ripples
We like the settings of the water, so let' paint mud around it because it would be weird to have grass below water.

The following isn't water but it is important in our process.

We're going to add another megascan asset.

This asset is called Icelandic Volcano in the megascan.

We are going to make it a little greener using the tint.
After watching Unreal Sensei, I can see that I put more care into plugging the holes in the landscape between the level and the mountains. For that, the icelandic volcano was very useful.
