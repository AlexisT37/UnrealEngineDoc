# Specular Strength and Distance

In unreal engine, what is the specular strength ? And I've heard of specular distance before, what is it ? give concrete example and a lot of details and speak to a beginner

Sure, let's talk about these concepts in terms that a beginner might understand.

## Specular Strength

The term "specular strength" or "specular intensity" in Unreal Engine (or any other 3D software) refers to the intensity or brightness of the specular reflection on a surface. It's a component of a material's properties that determine how it will interact with light.

To better understand it, imagine a shiny object like a polished apple or a plastic ball. When light hits the object, you usually see a bright spot where the light is directly reflecting off the surface. This bright spot is the specular highlight, and its intensity, or how bright it appears, is determined by the specular strength.

In Unreal Engine, you can adjust the specular strength of a material to create different effects. For example, if you're creating a rough, matte surface like concrete, you might set a low specular strength, because such surfaces don't reflect much light. Conversely, for a shiny surface like polished metal or wet paint, you would set a high specular strength to create a bright, intense highlight.

## Specular Distance

"Specular distance" is not a standard term in Unreal Engine or computer graphics in general. It might refer to the distance over which specular highlights are visible, or it might be a misunderstanding of another term like specular level, specular map, or specular reflection. These terms are all related to controlling the brightness and pattern of specular highlights.

For example, a specular map is a texture that controls the specular strength across different parts of a surface. It allows you to make certain parts of a surface shinier than others. You might use a specular map to create a surface that is mostly rough, but has some shiny spots, like a worn-out road or a rusty metal object.

In the context of PBR (Physically Based Rendering), which Unreal Engine uses, the term "specular" is a constant value used to define how much light a non-metallic surface reflects, often having a fixed value. But even in this context, the term "specular distance" isn't commonly used.

If you were referring to a different concept or using a different engine that uses the term "specular distance", please provide additional context so that I can give a more accurate explanation.

apparently the term specular distance was used in tes 4 oblivion

Ah, I see! The context of the term "specular distance" in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion makes sense now.

In Oblivion, and indeed in many games of that era, developers used various tricks to enhance the visual quality within the constraints of the hardware. One of these is "specular distance", which is a parameter that controls the distance at which specular highlights on a surface start to fade out or diminish.

This is an optimization technique more than a physical property of materials. By reducing the distance at which specular highlights are rendered, developers can save on computation and thereby improve performance. For example, if an object is very far away, it's less important to render subtle details like specular highlights, because the player is less likely to notice them. Instead, the game can use simpler, less computationally-intensive shaders for distant objects.

It's worth noting that this is a somewhat dated technique, and modern game engines like Unreal Engine 4 or Unity typically handle these details automatically as part of their LOD (Level Of Detail) systems. These systems adjust the complexity of object rendering based on distance, screen space, and other factors to ensure optimal performance and visual quality. However, in custom game engines or older games, you might still come across parameters like "specular distance".

Remember that these are broad strokes; the exact implementation of "specular distance" might differ depending on the specific game or engine.
