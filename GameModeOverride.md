# GameModeOverride

In Unreal Engine, a Game Mode defines the rules and logic for a particular type of game, such as the default pawn class, player controller class, HUD, and other gameplay-related settings. A Game Mode Override allows you to replace the default Game Mode for a specific level with a different Game Mode, which can be useful when you want to change the gameplay rules or mechanics for that level without affecting other levels in your project.

Let's use a concrete example to illustrate the concept:

Imagine you are creating a first-person shooter game with multiple levels. Most levels have the same basic gameplay mechanics: players can move, jump, shoot, and have a certain amount of health. You define these rules and logic in a Game Mode called "FPSGameMode".

Now, let's say you want to create a special level where the player has no weapons and must rely on stealth to complete the level. In this case, you can create a new Game Mode called "StealthGameMode" that inherits from your "FPSGameMode" but overrides specific settings to disable the shooting mechanics and modify other gameplay rules, such as enemy AI behavior or player movement speed.

To apply the "StealthGameMode" as a Game Mode Override in your stealth level:

1. Open the stealth level in the Unreal Editor.
2. Go to "Window" in the top menu and select "World Settings" to open the World Settings panel.
3. In the World Settings panel, locate the "Game Mode" section.
4. Find the "GameMode Override" property and click on the dropdown menu.
5. Choose your "StealthGameMode" from the list of available Game Modes.

Now, when you play this specific stealth level, the engine will use the "StealthGameMode" instead of the default "FPSGameMode". This allows you to have different gameplay mechanics and rules for this level without affecting other levels in your project that use the "FPSGameMode".

Remember that when creating custom Game Modes, it's essential to ensure that they inherit from the appropriate base class and override the necessary settings to achieve the desired gameplay changes.
