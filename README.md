lots of good ideas there,

try to simplify the problems you're trying to solve to the maximum

minimize hype for what's to come, reduce knowledge of what could come to minimum

maximize positive surprize, reduce expectations

minimize things to have together going in your head, like different things to have to manage, while having a very strong flow of something carrying you, like the desire to explore.

be fearless, don't be affraid to lose stuff, you can make backups, but don't be affraid to break stuff.

## Lessons from order of Ecclesia

You really don't want to have a death as a penalty, instead death should be a spectacle, not a source of crispation, what you want is something that will remove the fear of dying and promote exploration of different creative ways to die, because it is just another element of gameplay to be explored. win or die, or attempt and fail, aren't really special, they are just gameplay loops.

Order of Ecclesia tried to do the double weapon but it fails miserably because the lack of a special combination for different weapon pigeon holes you into having several pairs of the same weapon for the special attack. Therefore if you implement a gamplay mecanic you should really think of all the possible ramifications that are likely to occur in a player. Here is a good example.

The grappling hook:

should be usable on enemies
can adjust length
can swing in void but also against wall,
can attach during falling

much like in just cause.

If you have an alternate character for a video game, like in ecclesia, then it should either be a superset of the other player,
or at least have the ability to switch to a completed regular player because then you don't have to cut gameplay. You can at least switch to the regular character. Of course this should be doable at all times even mid fight with no restriction.

Flight should never have stationary and always require passive action from the player, otherwise immediate fall.
